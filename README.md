English parser for people learning English to see if a given phrase is commonly used in practice

Before running: get API keys from Twitter and Reddit, put into credentials.json file

This program is designed to give feedback on english phrases, but is no substitute for an english-speaking friend.


Enter a phrase in the search bar, and the program will list examples of that phrase from Twitter and Reddit, alongside a vague rating of accuracy. 

The accuracy measure is based on the number of upvotes, with the theory being that social media users do not upvote posts with grammatical or spelling errors.
